<p>The hotel, formerly known as Locanda Pagano, has been a gracious host to artists, poets,<br> writers, architects, painters and musicians, who all showed their gratitude by painting the walls,<br> writing poems, singing and playing. Due to this the hotel was also dubbed as the Artist's Hotel.</p>
<p>Hotel operations vary in size, function, complexity, and cost. Most hotels and major hospitality<br> companies have set industry standards to classify hotel types. An upscale full-service hotel<br> facility offers luxury amenities, full-service accommodations, an on-site restaurant, and the<br>highest level of personalized service,such as a concierge, room service.</p>
<p>Boutique hotels are smaller independent, non-branded hotels that often contain upscale facilities.<br> Small to medium-sized hotel establishments offer a limited amount of on-site amenities.<br> Economy hotels are small to medium-sized hotel establishments that offer basic accommodations with little to no services. Extended stay hotels are small to medium-sized hotels that offer longer-term full-service accommodations compared to a traditional hotel.</p>
<p>Some hotels are built specifically as a destination in itself to create a captive trade, example at casinos, amusement parks and holiday resorts. Though hotels have always been built in popular destinations, the defining characteristic of a resort hotel is that it exists purely to serve another attraction, the two having the same owners.</p>
